# Testify

## Intro

For our final project, we wanted to create a web app that would allow different people to generate Quizzes and auto run the correction process.
A Quizz is subdivided in multiple question which can be one of the three flavour down below :

* A True / False question
* A Multiple ( or Single ) choice quesiton
* A Fill-in-the-blank question

This project never really went in " production " and was always meant to be a showcase of what we were capable to do, as a team.

## Implemented features

- Multiple sort of question
- Multiple roles ( Student / Professor / Director / Admin)

## Never implemented features

- Edit / Remove a question
- Draft / Publish mode
- Reports and data for further analysis ( progression curve, average of student / classroom / professor )
